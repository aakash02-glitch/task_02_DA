# 🔍 Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic Dataset to understand passenger characteristics and the factors influencing survival. The workflow includes:

Importing and understanding dataset structure

Handling missing data (Age, Fare) and dropping high-missing columns (Cabin)

Cleaning and preparing data for analysis

Visualizing numerical and categorical distributions

Pairplots and correlation heatmaps to study relationships

Groupby analysis to explore survival patterns

Outlier detection using boxplots and IQR

The EDA reveals valuable insights such as the higher survival rate of females and first-class passengers.
This project demonstrates strong foundational data analysis skills using Python.
